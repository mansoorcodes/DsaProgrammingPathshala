Alice and Bob each created one problem for Programming Pathshala. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from
1
 to
100
 for three categories:
p
r
o
b
l

The rating for Alice challenge is the triplet
a
=
(
a
[
0
]
,
a
[
1
]
,
a
[
2
]
)
, and the rating for Bob challenge is the triplet
b
=
(
b
[
0

,
b
[
1
]
,
b
[
2
]
)
.

The task is to find their

 by comparing
a
[

 with
b
[

,
a
[

 with
b
[

, and
a
[

 with
b
[

.

If
a
[
i
]
>
b
[
i
]
, then Alice is awarded
1
 point.
If
a
[
i
]
<
b
[
i
]
, then Bob is awarded
1
 point.
If
a
[
i
]
=
b
[
i
]
, then neither person receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given
a
 and
b
, determine their respective comparison points.

Input Format

The first line contains three integers
a
[
0
]
,
a
[
1
]
 and
a
[
2
]
The second line contains three integers
b
[
0
]
,
b
[
1
]
 and
b
[
2
]
Constraints

Explanation
a
[
0
]
>
b
[
0
]
, so Alice receives
1
 point
a
[
1
]
=
b
[
1
]
, so nobody receives a point
a
[
2
]
<
b
[
2
]
, so Bob receives
1
 point

Hence, answer is
[
A

c
e
,
B
o
b
]
 =
[
1
,
