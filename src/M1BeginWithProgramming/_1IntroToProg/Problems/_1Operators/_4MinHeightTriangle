Given integers
b
 and
a
, find the smallest integer
h
, such that there exists a triangle of height
h
, base
b
, having an area of at least
a
.

Input Format

The first line contains integers
b
 and
a
Constraints
1 ≤ a,b ≤ 10^6
Output Format

Print the minimum integer height to form a triangle with an area of at least
a
Sample Input 1
2 2

Sample Output 1
2

Sample Input 2
17 100

Sample Output 2
12

Explanation The task is to find the smallest integer height of the triangle with base
2 and area at least 2 . It turns out, that there are triangles with height
 2 , base 2 and area 2 , for example a triangle with corners in the following points: (1,1),(3,1),(1,3)

It can be proved that there is no triangle with integer height smaller than
2
 , base
2
 and area at least
2
.
