Arty is daydreaming in DSA class. He has a sheet of graph paper with
n rows and
m columns, and he imagines that there is an army base in each cell for a total of
n
∗
m bases. He wants to drop supplies at strategic points on the sheet, marking each drop point with a red dot. If a base contains at least one package inside or on top of its border fence, then it is considered to be supplied.

n and
m, what is the minimum number of packages that Arty must drop to supply all of his bases?

Explanation Arty has four bases in a grid. If he drops a single package where the walls of all four bases intersect, then those four cells can access the package. 1479943282-a32d9bfad1-army-game.png (440×131) Because he managed to supply all four bases with a single supply drop, we print as our answer.
