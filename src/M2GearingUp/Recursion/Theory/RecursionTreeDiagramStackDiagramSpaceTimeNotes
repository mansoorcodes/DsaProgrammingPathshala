Let say we are calling this function for x where x <= 3 then the height of the recursive tree
will be 3 - x + 1 and in every function call we are invoking 2 more functions
and we are taking O(1) time for every function call so an upper bound
on time complexity can be 2 ^ (3 - x).

Space complexity will be O(3 - x) as that can be the max height if x <= 3
so we can also say O(max(0, 3 - x))
if x <= 3 then 3 - x will be >= 0
else 0 >= 3 - x
